<p><strong>What is Quadmax ?</strong> <br>
Quadmax was a project from 2014 to convert a large Mendelmax 3D printer with moving Y-moving bed to a printer with a Z-moving bed</p>

<p align=center>from extra wide Mendelmax to Quadmax</p>

 <p><strong>What software has been used</strong> <br>
For designing the printer Google Sketchup v8 has been used</p>

 <p><strong>Is this project still active ?</strong> <br>
Not really, this project was already done 2014 and i don`t own the printer anymore<br>
but everywone who want to can work further on this project </p> 

<p><strong>Why do want to do that ?</strong> <br>
Thats simple, reducing the weight of the moving masses which results in faster and better printing.</p>

<p><strong>What was the base Mandelmax of ?</strong> <br>
The original Mendelmax had following key features:</p>

<p>360x300mm Heatbed <br>
10mm Rod`s <br>
8mm Trapezoid spindle (TR 8x1,5) <br>
one Z-Stepper with Belt to move both Z axis <br>
controlled by a Sanguinololu 1.3a board</p>

<p><strong>What are noticeable spec`s</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>X Axis</p>

<p>a lightweight NEMA14 stepper is used instead of a heavy NEMA17 motor <br>
8mm rods instead of 10mm. <br>
the x-carrier works with most “50mm mounting hole” extruder but is optimized for <a href="https://www.youmagine.com/designs/nema-14-geared-extruder-rev-1-2">Nema 14 geared extruder</a></p></li>
<li><p>Y Axis</p>

<p>a NEMA17 Dualshaft stepper is mounted in between of the belts. <br>
on the opposite and a rod is used to ensure a better loadbalance and stability. <br>
10mm rods</p></li>
<li><p>Z Axis</p>

<p>s driven by only one NEMA17 steppermotor and a geared Belt system and uses TR8x1,5 spindles and nut`s. <br>
because of the Heated bed only lies on the Z-Nut there is virtually no Z-wobble <br>
the belt can be tightened by mounting the opposite Z-spindle sideways <br>
4x 10mm Z rods <br>
As spoolholder you can for example use the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30350">removeable variant</a> from the Orca printer </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why is there no BOM</strong> <br>
Because there are serval variants of Mendelmaxès out there so you have to check which parts you need and which you already have by your own.</p>

<p>maybe someone will make a BOM, add the missing sideplates or even some additional modifications.</p>
